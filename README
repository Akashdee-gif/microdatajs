Microdata is a syntax for embedding machine-readable metadata in HTML.

MicrodataJS currently has two separate implementations:

microdata.js mimics as closely as possible the syntax and behavior of
the API defined in the HTML specification. This requires support for
getters and setters (to emulate properties like itemValue) and will
therefore requires a somewhat "modern" browser/ECMAScript engine.

jquery.microdata.js is a jQuery that is functionally similar, but the
API is more jQuery-like. This implementation works on older browsers,
but obviously at the cost of depending on jQuery.
